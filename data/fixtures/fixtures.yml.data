The program is usually about an hour.\n* Yes, a list of student names will be available.   I will send  last year's program if  you send me your address.\n* The images that are taken may be used by TUSM news' outlets [alumni, etc.].\n* The pictures along with the bill will be sent to me.  \n\nAny additional orders by students would be paid by the student - in the past order forms were included with the picture in the  envelope.\n\nAlso, I am interested in an approximate cost.\n\n--from duplicate job:\nIndividual 5x7 photos of each student (about 170 students) with Dean Michael Rosenblatt as he congratulates them (shakes hand) on stage, photos of each speaker at podium, general candid shots of event. Commencement Photos has covered this event for us in the past. Ideally, we would also like a group shot of the entire class. Not sure if or where this could be done, given the size of the group.\n\n- Group photo: suggested that the students be assembled on the first floor with the photographer shooting from the balcony.  Also up to photographer's discretion. Students will be informed to gather in their white coats.  Colleen Romain, Carol Duffey, and other staff will be there helping to organize the students.\n\n- They want a set of candid shots on print as well, 8*10 (or bigger?) print of the group photo for the office, as well as the 170 prints (1 for each student) of the handshake\n\n* in the past, Commencement Photos used to include prints, frame, etc.  They are mainly going off their experiences with them\n\n\nAlso get shots of the front of the theater with the marquee\n\nMore details may come after the walk through\n<br/><br/>"

    notes: 'We usually have a photographer at Symphony Hall by 7:00 when guests start arriving and stay until the program is over, until around 10:30. Photos that are important are alumni milling around before hand, the performances of the a cappella groups during intermission, and the final act when the a cappella groups get on stage and sing with the Pops and ends with the balloon drop. As I mentioned in my request, the photographer has to be with a Symphony employee whenever he or she is shooting the stage; they are very strict about when and from where photographers can shoot the stage. Please let me know if you need any other info. I will be there that evening and can go over specific needed shots with the photographer.<br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>'

It is the main event of Alumni Weekend. Although the event goes until 11:00 pm, we only need a photographer to shoot the first few hours of cocktails, dancing, and the announcement of the classes with the highest gifts. The theme is a circus one and there will be circus decorations and a tent with games that alumni can play. We need some specific shots for our Alumni Weekend marketing material, which I can go over with the photographer. Please let me know if you need any more information.\n<br/><br/>"

    notes: "Includes 'wilderness':\nThis is for matriculation coverage. All the pre-orientation freshmen in Tufts Wilderness Orientation camp out on the quad (forget if it is res quad or academic quad) the night before matriculation then wake up early to go move in. I spoke to one of the Student Orientation Coordinators, Matt, and he said that on his end at least, it should be alright for someone to shoot the campout. He said that he will try to contact the Wilderness coordinators when they arrive tomorrow afternoon. The campout begins around 8/9 pm on Tuesday.\n  Please go and shoot set up for wilderness, and night scenes of camping on the quad. Then, ask when they are packing up in the morning.

    notes: "Hi Melody & Georgy,\n\nSharewood went beautifully! I was able to sit in on a private exam from \nstart to finish (we received permission from the patient). So I was \nprivileged to witness the whole process from the initial \ninformation-gathering consultation, which is conducted by the students, \nto the final diagnosis, administered by the doctor on staff. My story \nwill take the reader through the process using this example.\n\nWhat makes the Sharewood story so interesting is the very dramatic \nlearning curve that takes place in the space of three hours. These kids \nare first year medical students. They know about as much as you and I do \nabout practicing medicine. By the end of every Tuesday night, they've \nabsorbed volumes about how to diagnose and treat a variety of illnesses, \nhow to conduct a physical exam, how to behave around a sick and \nvulnerable person, and how to interact with fellow doctors. It's a \nthrilling process.\n\nSharewood is run entirely by students -- they do the admitting, file the \npatient records, and consult with patients. Many of the same students \nare there every Tuesday night, so you shouldn't have much trouble \nfinding the people I spoke with.\n\nSharewood is held in a large church auditorium, so the acoustics are \npretty lousy (unfortunate for any audio recording you might want to do). \nThere's a big empty space, which they half fill with individual \ncurtained cubicles, with a few cubicles set apart for HIV/STD screening. \nA pew and some chairs near the entrance serve as the patient waiting \narea. There's also a curtained stage -- behind this is where the \nstudents gather.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS: Students admit patients, have them fill out an information \nsheet, take their blood pressure and weight/height. Privately, they take \na case history. Then the students consult with a staff doctor, who \nquizzes them on their approach (did they remember to ask this or that, \netc.) The doctor examines the patient. Then the doctor and the students \nretire to discuss a diagnosis. Then they regroup with the patient and \ninform him/her and prescribe treatment.\n\nPossible photo opps:\n\n-- Students weighing/taking blood pressure of patients\n-- Students eagerly talking with a doctor about a patient\n-- Students looking through the shelves of the medicine cabinet at \npossible drugs to prescribe\n-- Students talking with each other about a diagnosis\n\nHere's a list of the people I spoke with at length (unfortunately, \ndidn't get phone #, as things moved so fast) -- I mentioned you would be \ncoming by in the next few weeks to take photos:\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nK.C. Collins (first year med student -- on the case I saw)\nwilliam.collins@tufts.edu\n\nMiriam Schwarz (first year med student -- on the case I saw)\nmiriam.schwarz@tufts.edu\n\nJeff Martin (first year med student, helps run Sharewood)\njeff.martin@tufts.edu\n\nJeff William (Student Administrative director)\njeff.william@tufts.edu\n\nBenjamin Caplan (first year med student)\nbenjamin.caplan@tufts.edu\n\nDOCTORS:\n\nJames Bath (Attending physician on the case I saw)\njames.bath@tufts.edu\n\nParra Tomkins (I need to follow up with Parra to get a quote)\n<parra.tomkins@tufts.edu><br/><br/>"

Sternberg, professor of psychology, adjunct professor of education, and dean of the School of Arts and Sciences entitled â€œInterdisciplinary Problem-Based Learning: An Alternative to Traditional Majors and Minors?â€ Since he mentions Tufts University, we are seeking photos from TU, to accompany the article, and to include in other areas of the publication (a selection between 5-10 would be great). We will also keep them on file, with your permission, to use in other AAC&U materials, as we often like to use our membersâ€™ images in our publications.\n\nWe like the photos to be non-staged shots of students, faculty, and your campus. And, if possible, some spring scenes would be nice to include in our spring issue.\n\nWe can use slides, snapshots, and digital images. If digital images are sent, images must be originally shot or scanned with at least 300 ppi, and be a minimum of 5x7 inches in size. Many of the photos that are used are 8.5 x 11, so the larger the better.\n\nIf requested, we will return all slides and photos We are more than happy to acknowledge all photographers that we are directed to, and will caption all photos with the name of the college. Once the journal is completed, we will send you a complimentary copy for your files.\n\nPlease send photos via mail or e-mail, by Thursday, February 7, 2008 to:\n\nE-mail: bossman@aacu.org\n\nDarbi Bossman, Production Manager\nAssociation of American Colleges and Universities\n1818 R Street, NW\nWashington, DC 20009\n\nIf I need to direct my request to someone else, please let me know. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions regarding our specifications or how we plan to use your photos.\n\nThank you in advance for your help, and I am looking forward to receiving your photos.\n\nGillian Carey<br/><br/>"

She\nwould be better able to tell you about the Mayor's potential\ncommitments, but please don't hesitate to contact me with further\nquestions.\n\nThanks!\nJackie\n\nEmail from Sarah Sliwa:\n\nHi Katy,\n\nMonday June 16th,\nWednesday June 18th before 1pm\nFriday June 20th and Monday June 30th\nare all days that Chris has large blocks of time available for a photo.\nAfter speaking with the Mayor's staff, let me know if there are any blocks of time you need me to hold.\n\nThanks,\nSarah\n\n5/31: What about Economos' schedule?

The next appointments are on July 1, but their day is packed with appointments for her and Madison. The Wordens will likely be staying over night so it may work better at another point during their stay. Katy should please invite the Wordens that Tufts will be glad to reimburse her for the cost of her lodging if staying overnight until July 2 or coming in early on June 30th will make it easier for Madison, and will allow them to connect with Abby. The Wordens should just send the hotel receipt to me and I will work to get a reimbursement paid to them. (I have confirmed this with Finance.)\n\n6/17: K, what's the update? I'd like the date we need to shoot this. Thanks, Melody\n\n6/17: Spoke w/ Abby. She suggested late afternoon on Mon. 6/30 (3:30 or 4:00) or first thing in the morning on 7/2. I left a voicemail for Bobbie Worden to see which date works best for them.\n-Katy<br/><br/>"

Will need to be shot  w/ very quick turnaround and approval by Blair's people before photos are released. Suzanne and Kim are the contacts. Suzanne is working out access and other details.\n-Katy\n\n1/26: Here are the notes I sent to Tia today - ANI:\n\nPARKING & ENTERING THE VENUE\n\nThe lecture will take place in Gantcher Center - 161 College Avenue, Medford, MA 02155.\n\nOur PR department has asked that you arrive at 4:30PM to pass security and meet the Secret Service team working for Mr. Blair.  \n\nThere will be \"media\" parking spots in the Cousens Parking lot (directly across the street from Cousens Gym/Gantcher Center on Boston Ave).  Members of the Tufts University Police Department will be directing traffic should you need assistance. \n\nGantcher Center is across the street from the parking area; attached to Cousens Gym.  You will enter through a door marked \"Hamilton Pool\" which should also have a media sign.  From there, staff members will direct you through security.  Please bring a photo ID.  You will be issued with a Tufts media credential for the lecture.\n\nTHE LECTURE:\nThe lecture starts at 5:30PM.  Over all, you will have about five minutes to photograph Mr. Blair.  After that window of opportunity has closed, we will need you to be prepared to turn around the photos for Mr. Blair's PR team as well as the Tufts University President's office. \n\nIMAGE DELIVERY:\nTurning around the photos - I am not sure what you prefer to do but I am open to a couple of possibilities.  I can have a laptop/card reader so that you can just transfer the photos to me right after shooting.  I can then edit and tone the images for our clients.  If you prefer to edit and tone, that is fine as well. Please let me know if you have other thoughts.    \n\nI have indicated to our PR folks that we can get them images to vet by about 6:30.  We will create an online gallery for the Blair PR folks and the Tufts team to view & approve the images prior to release.  \n<br/>tba<br/>"

This is a project involving engineering students from all disciplines--chemical, mechanical, electrical. Each winter, the power cable to the island gets severed by bad weather so the Girls are designing a solar system to power the lighthouses. In addition, they are looing at potential use of wind and tide for power. They are also working on water filtration systems. Like to get a dynamite front-page photo of the girls outside the lighthouse and another shot of your choice to run with the story inside.

James Dimon is the President and COO of JP Morgan.\n\nThe event begins at 5:00 p.m. in the Coolidge Room, there will be the Light on the Hill Award presentation by the TCU President, Jeff Katzin, and the President will also be making some remarks. Mr. Dimon will make some remarks as well and answer questions from any students who are in attendance. Then the reception will begin at about 5:45, on the other side of the Coolidge Room. There is no dinner associated. Mr. Dimon will be visiting campus with his daughter during the afternoon and meeting with the President before the award ceremony.\n\nI hope this helps. I can set up a meeting with you and Celeste if you'd like more details on what we'll need for photos.\n"

    instructions: "The WCC will take place on Saturday, September 9th, 2006 at the  Cutler LOCATION. Majestic Theatre at Emerson College, 219 Tremont Street,  Boston.  The tentative time table is 9:00am-noon.  It's at 219 Tremont.\n\nLights. I think two 580EX flashes on stands may help you with the lighting for the class photo but i checked the house lights and i think your on camera flashes on slave, toward the group might work fine. \n\nAssistant - Nicki Sobecki. She will help you make sure the names of the students coming across the stage are correct with your shooting. She will also do some backup shooting of candids before and after the event, and set up or hold lights if you need it.\n\n\nTransmit File name. Please name each student by Last name, First name. highest quality hi-res jpg.\n\nTransmit Deadline. I will need the images by Tuesday, Sept 12 at the latest.\n\nHere's the scheule and shot list.\n\n1- Arrive and meet between 8am - 9am - set up equipment, check out a few venues to take the \"shaking hand shot\" and take candid shots of students back stage, lining up, etc. \n\n2- 10am - cover the event. each speaker on the program, audience shots.  an overall of the stage with its faculty.\n\n3- 1030am - individual shots of students shaking hands with Dean Rosenblatt on stage.  It is  a class size of 171. You will be given a program with all the names of the students. if you are facing the stage, the students move from right to left. you will be on the left side ready to photograph the dean shaking hands with the student, they will probably turn towards you in anticipation for a photo. Please note that the dean is very tall so make sure you frame it so that he doesn't look awkward with the students. \n\nYou can either stand on a step stool or the first balcony. i'll leave it up to you as to where the best spot is. they are happy to work with you to test out the two locations before the event between 9-10am. I'd suggest which shot would look best and give them the option of what they want.\n\nNames. Nicki will bring a pad and pen to record and make sure the names are correct. They announce the names in alphabetical order but in case there is a screwup, we need to make sure we correctly identify the students with the photos. Nicki, get a program to follow along to make sure you're recording correctly.\n\n4- 11am - immediately after ceremony, take class photo. Students will stay in their seats. Ask them to stand and gather them together towards the middle seats to shoot the image from the stage. they will turn the house lights up and please make sure you have the fill flash you need to get a clear group photo.  compose it nicely and make sure it doesn't look to distorted. this means Nicki may need to help you position students on the sides so it looks neat. it should be pretty quick and easy but of course, make sure it's in focus! prob. something like aperture of at least f/7 but i'll leave that up to you.\n\n5- 1120pm - Both of you shoot candids with family.\n\n6- We need 5-6 nice photojournalistic candids for the Medical magazine and Tufts Journal \n\nplease call me if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you again for participating in the President’s Marathon Challenge, for your hard work and dedication to prepare to run 26.2 miles, and for your commitment to help us raise important funds for nutrition research. <br/>Adele and I would like to invite you to a pre-race carbo loading dinner on Sunday, April 16 at 6:00 p.m.  We will host the dinner in Cousen’s Gymnasium located on College Avenue on the Medford Campus.  This will be a strictly informal affair – in fact wearing running gear to keep your focus for race day is strongly encouraged.  We will all have our team singlets and hats prior to the dinner, so please bring them with you for team pictures.<br/>In addition to enjoying a menu selected by our nutrition experts Miriam Nelson and Chris Economos, the evening will give you a chance to relax with your fellow runners, perhaps hook up with a teammate who plans to run at the same pace, and get some last minute advice from Coach Don Megerle and his team.  We will get you home early so you can be well rested for race day.<br/>Please RSVP to donald.megerle@tufts.edu by Tuesday, April 11.  I look forward to seeing you at the dinner.<br/>'

    instructions: "James Jennings (available after 1/17), 7-3394, james.jennings@tufts.edu\nJulian Agyeman, 7-3394, julian.agyeman@tufts.edu\nRachel Bratt (back in town 1/11), 7-3394, rachel.bratt@tufts.edu\n\n\nHere is a rough rough story draft, to get a sense of what it is about. Basically, I'd love to get a shot of him out in the community (Roxbury, Dorchester) Maybe Dudley Square where there are lots of people and buses and storefronts and historic murals... talking about community development and activism. \n****************************************\nWhere Activism Meets Academia\n\nUrban and Environment Planning Professor James Jennings, stressing the importance of cooperation as a catalyst for social progress, advocates a holistic approach to both education and community development.\n\n	If you walk north along Blue Hill Avenue in Boston, youï¿½ll eventually approach the Grove Hall Mecca Mall.  Although it is adorned with a sign welcoming you to the Roxbury neighborhood, many residents nearby claim that the mall is, in fact, in Dorchester.\n	The boundary at play here is not one drawn by city planners.  Rather, key the unit of measurement is the community.  When he began researching and tackling social problems, James Jennings, a professor of urban and environmental planning at Tufts, approached them at the level of the community, as opposed to individuals and families, where many of his colleagues focused their energies.\nï¿½I could see a neighborhood interest,ï¿½ says Jennings.  ï¿½I didnï¿½t just see a bunch of children, or a bunch of families, or a bunch of individuals.ï¿½  Collecting data and counting numbers is important, he says, ï¿½but sometimes you lose sight of the bigger picture, that children, families and individuals all live in a neighborhood, and people identify with that neighborhood.ï¿½\nJennings never subscribed to the academic maxim, ï¿½if you canï¿½t measure it, it doesnï¿½t exist.ï¿½  To focus on the boundaries of a community, such as the Roxbury neighborhood, where Jennings helped develop the Roxbury Strategic Master Plan, is to miss the point.  \nï¿½People know, ï¿½This is our neighborhood,ï¿½ï¿½ says Jennings.  ï¿½They may not tell you exactly, if you cross this street [youï¿½ve left Roxbury], but neighborhood is a sense of togetherness, a sense of community.  Sometimes itï¿½s difficult to define that.ï¿½\n\nA Voice of Activism\n\nThroughout his life, Jennings has gone against convention.  When others saw poverty, Jennings saw potential.  The son of a Latino mother and an African-American father, Jennings grew up in Brooklynï¿½s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, and was surrounded by protests and riots during his youth.  \nï¿½It was a very impoverished area, with a lot of problems and challenges,ï¿½ he acknowledges, but ï¿½a neighborhood with a lot of resources and assets, a lot of important history.ï¿½\nJennings also spent time in San Juan, Puerto Rico with his grandmother, who worked as a maid.  ï¿½She represented a real struggle on behalf of social justice, on an individual level,ï¿½ he says.  Jennings would often accompany her to work, and remembers fondly the lessons he learned.  ï¿½I got to see how human nature is universal,ï¿½ he recalls.  ï¿½You can be poor, you can be rich, but there are a lot of commonalities, both good and bad.ï¿½\nJennings excelled at his studies, and after graduating from Hunter College in New York City in 1971, he pursued a Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University.  As he began to study community issues around the country, he noticed that ï¿½certain stories were missing, certain voices were absent,ï¿½ including a ï¿½voice of activism in academia.ï¿½  He approached his advisor at Columbia, a prominent professor in his field, with a proposal for a dissertation on Puerto Rican leadership patterns in Spanish Harlem, and how they related to the Civil Rights movement and the war on poverty.\nJennings was met with immediate resistance.  ï¿½I remember him saying, ï¿½Well, thereï¿½s no significance to that.  People really donï¿½t care about a story like that, you should do it on something like interest groups in America.ï¿½ï¿½  Jennings was shocked by the apparent apathy among members of the academic community.  He remembers thinking, ï¿½If this is representative of the intellectual elite in this country, we have some very serious problems here.ï¿½\nJennings applied his progressive values outside the classroom, as well.  While pursuing his doctorate, he stayed active in the community by directing the Higher Education Opportunity Program at Long Island Universityï¿½s Brooklyn Center.  ï¿½The focus of this program was the provision of supportive services to women on public assistance who were attending college,ï¿½ recalls Jennings.  ï¿½The aim was to empower and encourage low-income women to complete four years of higher education.ï¿½\nIt was a very controversial program, says Jennings, as most public policy experts believed that ï¿½the last thing we need to do for women who are poor, who are on public AFDC (Assistance of Families with Dependent Children), is encourage them not to work.ï¿½\nJennings stayed with the program for two years, and it proved a great influence on his life.  ï¿½It showed me the power and the impact of public policy on peopleï¿½s lives,ï¿½ he recalls.  ï¿½I saw women who had very little self-confidence, who after receiving some tools, and an opportunity to learn, became very, very powerful human beings.ï¿½\n\nFacilitating Partnerships\n\nJennings believes that community activism is an essential part of a well-rounded academic career.  ï¿½There are perspectives and methodologies that emerge from being more activist oriented,ï¿½ he says, ï¿½versus just working with numbers in the ivory towersï¿½ of the academic world.\nJennings has always focused on the integration of theory and practice.  ï¿½I donï¿½t see them as separate worlds,ï¿½ he says.  ï¿½For me, higher education has always been an important bridge between knowledge and whatï¿½s occurring at a local level.ï¿½  Jennings wants to use his position to ï¿½collect information in a way that can be used to improve peopleï¿½s lives.ï¿½  Rather than simply studying a problem, Jennings looks for a solution. \nJennings has applied this progressive approach to a variety of community issues over the years.  Recently, he was commissioned by the Arlington Trabajando Community Development Corporation to study the economic needs of small businesses in the Arlington neighborhood in Lawrence, ï¿½a very impoverished, working class areaï¿½ outside of Boston.  Jennings saw a large number of what he calls ï¿½micro-enterprises,ï¿½ small businesses with five employees or less.  ï¿½It was remarkable to see this poor area with such a tremendous amount of economic activity.ï¿½\nHe also saw that the various banks in Arlington were not responsive to the neighborhoodï¿½s needs, in terms of the number of ATM machines, the banksï¿½ hours, the people they hired, and the loans that they granted.  Jennings knew there was economic potential, and his report helped open some eyes among bank executives.  ï¿½What I hoped to do is remind [them] that even in poor communities, in places like Lawrence, thereï¿½s tremendous, tremendous economic assets that can be tapped that have implications for how leaders envision developing and moving a city forward.ï¿½  \nJennings is a realist, and while he understands that companies are primarily motivated by money, he believes in a symbiotic relationship between community development and financial success.  When he speaks to companies and corporations, he stresses how ï¿½working together, working in partnershipsï¿½ with community activists can help them ï¿½meet their agenda.ï¿½\nï¿½What I try to do,ï¿½ says Jennings, ï¿½is get business leadersï¿½to think differently about what their role is in the community, what they should be involved with, and how that helps them reach their bottom line.ï¿½\n\nSmall Steps\n\nIn 2001, Jennings made the move to Tufts, where he found ï¿½the space to analyze issues and problems, the nature of problems, and figure out what kinds of public policies, what kinds of community development strategies might be most effective.ï¿½  \nThe tenet of citizenship was just one of many factors that drew Jennings to Tufts ï¿½ aside from an office within biking distance of his house.  ï¿½In addition to the public service mission, I really wanted the opportunity to do more teaching,ï¿½ says Jennings, ï¿½to integrate my research and my community work into the classroom.ï¿½  Jennings helped institute the Neighborhood Fellows Program, which provides full graduate scholarships for a small, diverse group of community practitioners who bring invaluable real-world experience to class discussions.\nWhether in his class, or in a meeting with community leaders, Jennings stresses the importance of building relationships across organizational boundaries.  Yet he knows heï¿½s fighting an uphill battle; change is never easy, and cooperation is hardly a given.  ï¿½Just getting people to think about things a little bit differently, to ask certain questions,ï¿½ says Jennings, is a step in the right direction.\n"

Thanks!\n\nEVENT DETAILS:\nScholarship presentation on Friday afternoon with a former NASA astronaut, who is also a Tufts grad. \n\n****************************************\nRICK HAUCK, A62, ASTRONAUT\nTRUSTEE EMERITUS\nBOARD MEMBER, ASTRONAUT SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION\n\n\"It is vital that America remains a technological leader, and that responsibility rests upon our future generations.\"\n\nFRIDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2006\nLECTURE AND AWARD PRESENTATION 1:30–2:30 P.M.\nNELSON AUDITORIUM, ANDERSON HALL\nMEDFORD/SOMERVILLE CAMPUS\n\n\nThe Astronaut Scholarship Foundation is a nonprofit organization established in 1984 by the six surviving members of America’s original Mercury astronauts. Its goal is to aid the United States in retaining its world leadership in science and technology by providing scholarships for exceptional college students pursuing degrees in these fields. Hauck, who is a board member of the foundation, said that the organization “is a way for me and my fellow astronauts to give back to a country that that has afforded us an extraordinary opportunity.”  The foundation selected students for its prestigious scholarship based on motivation, imagination, and exceptional performance in the science or engineering field of their major.  Tufts School of Engineering is proud to have a 2006 ASF winner in electrical engineering senior Kyle Bradbury, who is involved in research which utilizes the brain signals that are provided by an electroencephalogram of epileptic patients to detect seizures before they occur.\n\nHauck received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Tufts University in 1962. In 1978, NASA named Hauck to its astronaut corps. Hauck flew on three Space Shuttle missions, including command of the redesigned spaceship on its critical first flight after the explosion of Challenger. His first flight assignment was a pilot for Challenger in 1983 on the seventh shuttle launch. The second was Discovery in 1984, which was history’s first space salvage mission to rescue two communications satellites that were stranded in orbit. Third and final flight, after the explosion of the Challenger in 1986, NASA selected Hauck to command a crew of five veteran shuttle fliers to test the redesigned spacecraft.\n\n"

So what I am requesting is photography of the performances from the different groups. If it is possible to get crowd reaction and perhaps some backstage shots too (showing prep, nervousness etc.) those would be great.\n\nNOTE: We are still feeling our way through this and making sure it is viable -- hopefully we will be talking to the students and learning more about the show, etc. If for some reason this falls through conceptually, we will let you know.

    instructions: "Dear Photo Team and (or) Melody,\nI'm writing from the Tufts Dance Program to see if any last minute arrangement might be made to shoot part of the first dance concert in the newly renovated Jackson Dance Lab. This is a very \nhectic time with limited crew, so faculty are very caught up in the minute to minute plans. Not until I saw an email this evening did I realize that Tufts photogaphers can be requested on webforms, etc.\nI did read that \"emergency\" service is sometimes possible, so I decided that I would have nothing to lose by investigating. I don't know the price, so this is of some concern. But below are our concert times and dates. The event is an hour. Or the final 30 min would be the next choice. Flash could not be used, but the stage lighting is often quite bright. The other limitaion is that the photographer would have to be established in one location rather than walking around. We've been using photos from a shoot about 5 years ago, and every year we are short-handed for the concert so details like this don't \nget planned. If anyone is minding the store this weekend and wants to get some really beautiful images (if we can afford the price) here's the show info.\n\nSat/Sun at 8 and Sun at 4; Jackson Dance Lab Performance Ensembles Concert by Daniel McCusker one hour contemporary dance also including string quartet.\nlimited seating\n\nThe best plan for contact is to email me or call my office as I'll be checking both. Mention price and availability, and I'll get back to you. I know that this is a long shot, but our Fall performance is the most impressive of the several that we do each year.\nRegards,\nAlice Trexler (alice.trexler@tufts.edu) 617-627-2555\nDirector, Tufts Dance Program  and for Daniel McCusker, Artistic Director"

I'm waiting for the final draft of the story. Think picture story and possible photo gallery highlighting good work by Tufts med students. See some brief description below. \n\nSharewood is run entirely by students -- they do the admitting, file the \npatient records, and consult with patients. Many of the same students \nare there every Tuesday night, so you shouldn't have much trouble \nfinding the people I spoke with.\n\nSharewood is held in a large church auditorium, so the acoustics are \npretty lousy (unfortunate for any audio recording you might want to do). \nThere's a big empty space, which they half fill with individual \ncurtained cubicles, with a few cubicles set apart for HIV/STD screening. \n\nA pew and some chairs near the entrance serve as the patient waiting \narea. There's also a curtained stage -- behind this is where the \nstudents gather.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS: Students admit patients, have them fill out an information \nsheet, take their blood pressure and weight/height. Privately, they take \na case history. Then the students consult with a staff doctor, who \nquizzes them on their approach (did they remember to ask this or that, \netc.) The doctor examines the patient. Then the doctor and the students \nretire to discuss a diagnosis. Then they regroup with the patient and \ninform him/her and prescribe treatment.\n\nThe story is running the following week so we need the photos on Wed. \n\nMORE INFO TO COME WHEN IT ARRIVES. THANKS\n\n\n "

A shot of Dr. Faissler in surgery would be great. \n\nPlease page Dr. March at the front desk of the small animal hospital. Dr. Sam Kegge as well. He will most likely be working with you for photos in the MRI room.\n\nPlease take photos looking from the outside, perhaps from the control room,  reviewing the xrays, etc. If you can go into the MRI room and get a front on shot looking down into the MRI machine with a pet patient inside, that would be a great, graphic opening shot for the feature. \n\nPlease also try to get students, residents, working on patients in procedure in the CT scan room. \n\nThere's a Great Dane in hospital with a likely trauma-induced stroke (fell on ice, hit head, now stroke symptoms). MRI was already done today. But if we can get the images from it, and you can get a shot of the recuperating dog tomorrow, we'll probably have a nice overall documentary of the work in the neuro suite. \n\n"

I think about 8 students are involved in the team.  <br/>They would like to use a bridge shot for the main introductory photo spread for admissions catalog. We need:<br/>1) unstaged group shots (some very close up with people in the<br/>background<br/>and the bridge in the foreground, others from a more wide angle)<br/>2) details of the bridge itself<br/>3) details of the equipment or tools they are using<br/>4) images of the students in action using the equipment<br/>Keep in mind that the group shots would be used in a two page spread (so mostly horizontal images would be best), so keep in mind what she is positioning in the middle of the image<br/>where the bind of the book would fold.<br/>They practice tonight starting at 8pm in the lobby of Anderson Hall. Perhaps there might be an interesting photo at night looking through the front doors of the building?<br/>They practice tomorrow 8pm and friday noon as well.'

They were referred to the program through Boston Asian Youth Essential Service (YES), which serves 350 kids from the Boston area. The van is operated by the Massachusetts Dental Society with funding from Procter & Gamble.<br/>These kids have basically fallen through the cracks and most of them have severe dental issues. Tuftsâ€™ only fear is that they wonâ€™t be able to treat all of those who are rapidly signing up during the four days. (The van has just 2 operatories).<br/>The van will be at 199 Harrison from 9 a.m. to 4:30 or 5 p.m. all four days (Iâ€™ll have firm confirmation on the time within the next week).<br/>The person organizing this for Tufts is Ginger Burns, a hygienist in the pediatric dentistry department. Best to reach her on her cell: 617-818-5264.<br/>This story hits all the requisite buttons: access to care, serving the underserved, civic engagement.<br/>'

The Center serves as a venue for community activities of all kinds, and focuses on promoting artists and musicians from the backlands. Our main focus is education for empowerment.\"  \n\nI spoke with Gerdes today and he's going to mail me some photos from his work at the school and cultural center.\n\nGerdes is going to be in Haiti from June 21-August 13, after that he's going to be in Florida, where he and his wife live.  He can be reached via e-mail at gerdes@bellsouth.net or via cell at 954-319-0459.\n\nI'm not sure about our options for photos.  A possibility might be doing what we did with the Field article (i.e., use some of the photos that we are sent and also set up our own photo shoot, which would take place in Florida).  As an FYI, Gerdes' article will be for the inside back cover of the magazine, so it will be shorter than the Field piece.  \n"

Toward the end of the presentation, there will be an interactive exercise where the students will be writing on paper with markers and talking to each other. This would be a great opportunity to get shots of students interacting with each other at individual tables. Again, it is not necessary to have shots of every table. Just a few good shots of the interaction between some students.\n\nArrival of students will be between 3:30-4 or 4:15pm. So this is when headshots of the incoming students & faculty/staff could be taken.\n\nThe presentation will begin at about 4:15pm, so this is when the table shots and speaker shots could be taken.\n\nThe presentations will be done no later than 6pm. Then there will be a buffet. No further shots will be required."

The melody of each music selection will be\nplayed three or four times. Again, this session is not mandatory, is not\npart of the callback, and is simply for learning purposes. For those who\nare already familiar with the music or learn it on their own, we will\nalso review the selections briefly in the callback.\n\nIf you are called back for a Kit Kat Klub role, please come to callbacks\nin clothing you can move in and bring any dance shoes you may have\n(socks/bare feet are fine as well).\n\nFinally you all need to know something very important, whether or not\nyou were called back: Cabaret is very different from a lot of musicals.\nIt calls for a particular kind of voice, a particular quality of\nphysical movement. So many of you are so right for many musicals, and we\nknow youâ€™ll shine in future shows at Tufts. As you know, it was a very\nlong process, and while narrowing things down to the list above was\ntremendously difficult, the auditions were a sincere pleasure.

Once the individual layers have dried, you can count how many winters and summers occurred over a certain period. They are actually trying to fill in some gaps from a similar 4,400-year geologic timeline for New England that was done in the 1920s by a Swedish geologist, Ernst Antevs.\n\nWe need photos of Jack with his dirt samples in the lab, and maybe take some outside in a more realistic environment.

Or it could be broken up into two different dates (women on Tuesday, men on Wednesday), if that's easier. Plus there are other dates/times besides Tuesday-Wednesday. It's definitely better to shoot at the pool during daylight hours. Let me know how the schedule looks next week and if you can fit this in\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul Sweeney\nSports Info Director\nAthletics\n\nKaty,\n\nI'm definitely last-minute with this request. The women's conference championships are next weekend (Feb. 22-24). After that, the season is over for them except for a few swimmers who may go on to national competition. So most of that team would not be at practice to photograph after next week. The men's conference championships are Feb. 29 to Mar. 2, so there's more time for them. Perhaps just the women could be done next week. This idea kind of just popped into my head today. If the women can't be done next week because of scheduling issues, it's not a problem.\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul "

The description of the event, as portrayed by Jane: "For my Tisch Scholar project this year I''m organizing the Somerville Money Fair, which will take place on April 5th on 277 Broadway (Elizabeth Peabody House) from 10-2.  I think that''s a great place for the photographer to take pictures because the fair has been my culminating work for this entire year.  And I''ll be in action as a ''Tisch Scholar.''" These photos will be used for a profile of Jane as part of our "Four Years, Infinite Possibilities" homepage feature. Georgy is going to be away on a conference beginning the 8th, so it would be great if would could have these on the 7th.'

It will be for the Beyond Boundaries section of the Summer 08 issue of Tufts Magazine. He graduated from Tufts in 1983 and has great memories and is \"adopting\" the class of 2008 for the 3-2-1- Blastoff! challenge. It might be fun to shoot him with the cannon to play off the \"Blastoff\" idea. We want to get his enthusiasm across, and there should be some good opportunities durring alumni weekend.\n\nthanks,\nMargot"

We would also like photos of students  posing together and shots of any of the collateral materials (folders, booklets, shirts etc.) with GIFT written on them.

Along with the students, we would like this shot to include Dean Pepall, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and Sinaia Nathanson, director the GIFT Program.  The students in the program will also be given shirts advertising the GIFT program during the breakfast.  With this said, we would like to have group photos of the students wearing the shirts and photos of them wearing the clothes \nthey came to the breakfast in.\n\nWorkshop-\"Triggers and Hooks to Engage Students\" led by Steve Cohen: 9:00-11:30\n\nThis is the first workshop of the program and it's being led by education professor Steve Cohen.

We \nwould also like photos of any of the printed materials he's using (pamphlets, booklets, etc.) which include the name of his workshop and/or GIFT along with any multimedia elements he's uses during the \nworkshop.  In addition, we would like photos of the students in attendance watching the lecture, working together, conversing with each other, and speaking with Professor Cohen.  These photos are very important, as the collaborative nature of the workshops is a key them of the program.   Steve may also take his students outside the classroom during his workshop (to the Tufts Memorial Steps) and, if so, we would like photos similar to those requested above.\n\nPlease note:  The breakfast and workshop photos may be included on the GSAS website and need to be sized in a way that can be used on our homepage and other parts of the website."

See synopsis below:<br/>Ainâ€™t Misbehavinâ€™: It doesnâ€™t matter how many restoration techniques a dentist knows or the amount of fancy technology in a practice. If the practitioner canâ€™t keep the patient in the chair, none of the other stuff matters. Enter the relatively new field of behavioral science, which attempts to fathom what makes a patient tick, determine why many patients donâ€™t like going to the dentist and devises behavioral modification solutions for patients to overcome their anxieties. Arthur Weiner, D58, is one of the pioneers in this nascent field, spurred on by his original work in agoraphobia at Mass. General in the late 1970s, when he noticed that some patients waiting for their dental appointments inexplicably ran out of the reception area. (He continues to publish in the field and has a new article coming out in the May issue of the Journal of the Massachusetts Dental Society.) Now, all U.S. dental schools are required to have a behavioral science program to maintain their accreditation, and the National Board exams have a hefty section on behavioral science. At Tufts, all third-year students are required to take a two-semester course in behavioral science. Among other tools, Weiner has developed a questionnaire, which is given to clinic patients after a student has seen the patient four or five times to assess that intangible, human side of dentistry. Interviews with students, patients, Albert Forgione, a dental psychologist whoâ€™s also published with Weiner and is co-editor of the book Behavioral Dentistry and works at the TMJ Center; Carole Palmer, who chaired the behavioral science part of the schoolâ€™s recent accreditation. There is also a psychologist on the staff of the TMJ Center.<br/>Letâ€™s avoid the â€œdentist working on patient shotâ€ and try to show the interaction of Weiner with patient. <br/>Heâ€™s at the dental school Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and his cell phone # is 617-680-7704.<br/>'

    instructions: "Zenda is the first Ph.D. grad in the history of the Cummings School. (She got her degree in May). Her doctoral research had a public health/zoonotic disease focus: rsearching tuleremia (rabbit fever) on Martha's Vineyard. There are, apparently, two forms of tuleremia: Type A, transmitted through the airways, and Type B, picked up through contact with an open sore, I believe. Zenda did her work on Type A, which has so far been confined to one island in North America, Martha's Vineyard. Apparently, Zenda's great-great-grandmother died of rabbit fever (Type B) in Kansas in the 1920s after she dressed a rabbit for dinner, developed an ulcer on her finger that was never treated, and then died.\n\nZenda is spending the summer and into the fall doing postdoctoral research in Saul Tzipori's lab. Need a nice portrait of her to go with a story that Kaitlin Melanson is doing for enews and for Tufts Veterinary Medicine.\n\n1/4 page portrait. vertical/square\n\nYou'll need to make the photos available to WebComm and 2communique through Merlin.\n\nNote: Please let Tom Keppeler (tom.keppeler@tufts.edu) know when you'll be shooting on the Grafton campus.

    instructions: "IMPORTANT\nCarol is a major donor to the university and should be treated as such. In addition, she has already been through one attempt to schedule a shoot, with Jodi, but because their schedules will not align, Jodi has to opt out, and we need to work through University Photography to get the shot assigned. Whoever calls her to do the scheduling would be wise to apologize for the inconvenience and this, the second set of phone calls to try to schedule this shoot.\n\nBACKGROUND\nCarol Goldberg has established a seminar series at Tufts. The photographer can read about it here:\n\nhttp://activecitizen.tufts.edu/?pid=500\nhttp://www.tbf.org/tbfgen1.asp?id=1705\n\nWe are featuring her in the next edition of the campaign newsletter. Our office's liaison to Carol has confirmed that Katy can contact Carol directly to schedule a shoot either with Carol and Avram (her husband) or with just Carol alone (it would be Carol's choice about whether she wants to be shot alone or with her husband).  Carol's number is 617.695.1300.\n\nThe newsletter in which this image will appear is here:\nhttp://www.kintera.org/atf/cf/%7B35758AB2-C67C-4FAF-9175-14BF21B91B26%7D/BB_News_W08_all-single_FINAL.pdf\n\nSCHEDULING\nThe photo cannot be shot until after September 2nd, as Carol is out of town until then. However, to make sure that this is shot as soon as possible after the 2nd, we would like the photo shoot to please be *scheduled now* even though it cannot be done until after 9/2/08.\n\nASSIGNMENT\nIf Alonso is not available, we'd like to use Tia Chapman if at all possible. Carol Goldberg is only available after September 2nd and Jodi Hilton (whom we tried first) is not available at that time.\n\nPREPARATION\nWhoever is assigned the photo should please call Mike Sherman at 627-6316 to get art direction in advance of the photo.\n\nCONTACT INFO\nIf there are questions about this shoot during the week of August 18th, please direct them to Marny Ashburne at 7-3444 or marny.ashburne@tufts.edu as I will be on vacation with no access to email.\n\nTURNAROUND TIME\nThrough no one's fault, the subject is not even available until after our deadline (Aug. 28) for sending images to the designer for layout. For this reason, I am going to put a ridiculous \"needed by\" date in the field below, as an request that we please get the photos as soon as possible. Thanks very much for the fire drill!"

The premise is to interpret a scientific study through dance. The goal of the contest is to engage the public more in science by promoting collaboration between the fields of arts and science. Entrants submit their dances through videos.<br/> Lara Park is a second year graduate student in the Biochemical and Molecular Nutrition program at the Friedman School who has also been dancing for most of her life. She will be entering the competition this year. <br/>Based on her PhD, she has choreographed a group piece about the epigenetic connections between folate depletion and colorectal carcinogenesis. In order to support the theme of collaboration between arts and science, she is hoping to choreograph the piece with half scientists and half dancers. On Saturday, she is planning to teach the dance to people and also videotape it. <br/>I plan to use this as a feature photo in the magazine. Because she is only entering the contest and not winning it, I will probably only use only photo (unless, of course, she ends up winning!)'

    instructions: "Dr. Lino Calvani is a part-time TUSDM faculty member and can be reached most easily at l.calvani@alice.it. He has been made aware via email this morning that although we have a head shot of him, the editor of the magazine has asked for a shot of him in a dental operatory because the story is about his gift to a TUSDM operatory (see the attached draft of the story for background) in the Vertical Expansion of the school.\n\nWe don't know for certain that Dr. Calvani is back in Italy currently but we expect he is, so we need to secure an Italian photographer for this. Per my conversation with Katy this morning, she kindly offered to pursue a lead on her end, and we will on ours, with the aim of getting a photographer identified this week. In addition, Katy offered to reach out to Dr. Calvani now to identify a time that would be convenient for him before Karen Bailey's deadline (before the Christmas holiday).\n\nKaty: Thanks in advance for securing time on Dr. Calvani's calendar. If you learn from Dr. Calvani that he is unable to be shot in the next ten business days (or so), please let me know as soon as possible. There is another donor (in Maine) in the story whom we could pursue instead, but we'd need to switch gears very quickly to make that one happen instead."

The kids will be doing a run through of their presentation that they will give at 12:30, so it might be easier to get the photography done then. We might want a few shots of the audience watching them do this hang gliding simulation, but thatâ€™s less important than getting a good shot of the actual tech.<br/>Thanks for letting me know if thatâ€™s feasible.<br/>Best,<br/>-Julia<br/>(Also, probably will be cost sharing this shoot with UIT).<br/>'

Summary:\n\nIn the last five years, text message campaigns, online social networks, and citizen media have played a major role in world events including a democratic revolution in Ukraine, a humanitarian emergency in Kenya and the election of the first African American President of the United States. This course explores how digital technology changes both the mode and the meaning of democratic participation. We will conduct this inquiry through the exploration of case studies and by putting an experimental social networking application to the test, exploring its use in civic projects throughout Boston.\n\nThey have a course wiki and course Twitter account (twitter.com/digidemocracy)\n\nThe class is held Tuesdays 6:00-8:30 PM, Murrow Room, Cabot Center. That setting is not the most technological, visually. One possible idea (though I leave it to your discretion) is to shoot them at the VizWall if you want to get something like their Twitter feed in the background.

    instructions: "This is a real-world exercise organized by the students co-teaching the Counterinsurgency Seminar ExCollege class. (full info below) I will be interviewing them after the fact to narrate an audio slideshow using these images.\n\nI'm currently confirming with the organizers which 1-to-2 hour time block would be best on that day.\n\nI would think that you'd want to send a freelancer out on this assignment, since it's a Sunday, and that'd be fine :-) Prob. need to wait on the time confirmation though.\n\n\nCOUNTERINSURGENCY-HUMANITARIAN FIELD EXCERCISE*\n\nTufts University is conducting its first combined counterinsurgency-humanitarian field exercise next month, on 8 March, 2009. Roughly 60 students from Tufts and Fletcher will descend upon the woods of Bridgewater, MA (about an hour south of Medford), and run through an all-day exercise in a life-size village and adjacent refugee camp. Students from EXP-62: Counterinsurgency Seminar will be learning the ropes of counterinsurgency while several Fletcher students from the joint Tufts/MIT/Harvard Humanitarian Studies Course will practice their refugee camp management skills. Insurgents and journalists will add to the realism.\n\n\nThe village and the refugee camp will be home to about 30 students playing various roles, from village elder to priest, to criminal, to teenage firebrand. We will try to simulate the internal politics of the village and camp as accurately as possible within the context of a dynamic political situation that will see a rise in violence and tensions between all groups. We're still looking to recruit high quality people with a sense of humor and adventure to play these civilians. None of you will be bored as you claw your way up the social ladder, collude with soldiers and insurgents, protect your children and your faith, or find yourself in one of many other challenging situations throughout what we expect to be a memorable day.\n\nIf you're interested in participating in this rather unusual event, please contact Toby Bonthrone (toby.bonthrone@tufts.edu <https://webmail.tufts.edu/horde/services/go.php?url=mailto%3Atoby.bonthrone%40tufts.edu>) or Chas Morrison (chas.morrison@gmail.com <https://webmail.tufts.edu/horde/services/go.php?url=mailto%3Achas.morrison%40gmail.com>). \n\nParticipants: 76 participants total. Groups represented include EXP:62 Counterinsurgency seminar (19 participants), the Institute for Global Leadershipâ€™s Alliance Linking Leaders in Education and the Services (ALLIES â€“ 10 participants), the Fletcher School (min. 9 participants) and the IGLâ€™s Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship (EPIIC) class of 2008-2009 (9 participants), with some overlap between groups.\n\nTimings:\n1700, 7 March: 32 Combatants (insurgents & counterinsurgents arrive in exercise area and build team cohesion through patrolling and other challenges.\n0800-0900 8 March: 40 non-combatants (civilians, journalists, NGO workers) arrive.\n0930 8 March: The exercise begins in full at this point and participants cycle through a series of scenarios reflecting a combined refugee crisis and insurgency.\n2000 8 March: 28 non-combatants leave. 12 remain overnight. Scenarios continue until the following morning\n0730 9 March: end of exercise. Return to Tufts, get washed, head to 1030 classes.\n\nLocation: P&L Paintball, Bridgewater, MA."

    instructions: 'This is a piece for the homepage on engineering Professors of the Practice. If your not familiar with this term, these are engineers who worked out in industry and are now teaching courses here. The story looks at how their industry experience brings a unique twist to their teaching/mentoring styles. Five different professors will be featured in this piece, but we are only looking for photos with the ones that have something visually interesting to offer. I have discussed this in person with Joanie. These are the three shoots we are looking at:<br/>1) Eric Hines<br/>Contact: emhines@lemessurier.com<br/>617-868-1200 x440<br/>Prof. Hines works at a design corp in Cambridge. His company is currently working on three building projects in the area. All the assignments he does with his class relate to real life work including these three structures. The idea is to get photos of Hines, the structures and some of the assignments the students have done involving the structures, tying them together. He is on board with taking a photographer on a tour of the projects so he should be easy to work with. He is also sending me some of his own photos of the building projects so when I get them I will send them along to you so you have a better feeling for what you are getting into.<br/>2) Dan Hannon<br/>Contact: Dan.Hannon@tufts.edu<br/>(603) 475 - 6141 <br/>This would be our in classroom shot. Prof. Hannon models all of his assignments as RFPs (Request For Proposals). The idea would be to have a sort of fanned image of several RFPs on his desk looking with the photographer looking out at the classroom and having the RFPs in focus and the students out of focus. Then some shots of Hannon teaching, possibly writing on the board etc.<br/>3)Steve Matson<br/>smatson@charter.net<br/>(617) 627-4186<br/>Prof. Matson has some pretty cool machinery from his industry work on display in his office, Sci Tech 274. We would like photos of the machinery, maybe some with him in it kind of explaining how things work and just some general portraits of him as well.<br/>Any of the three could possible render main images for the homepage. So just keep that in mind with all of them. <br/>This is slated to run March 16. I will be out from March 11 - March 24 so as it gets close to the run date you may be working more with Georgy on final selections than me.<br/>Thanks guys!!<br/>--------------<br/>From Katy:<br/>SCHEDULE<br/>Dan Hannon: Mon. 3/9, 6:00 pm, Anderson 212 (class)<br/>Steve Matson: Tues, 3/10 12:45, SciTech 274<br/>Eric Hines: Fri. 3/6, 10:00 am at 1 Post Office Square  (near Meridian Hotel, shoot building sites w/ students)'
